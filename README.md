# Cryptics
In thsi project we have implemented a dummy transaction system which is highly safe and will holding secured network with all the data stored in the Blockchain network for all the transaction data. The login and registration modules will also be very safe, it might not a having its own Blockchain but will be secured as all the important data like password and address will be going through the process of hashing and salting before being stored in the database. There will be other modules in the project like balance check and all the transaction history. The main aim for us in this project is to setup a very secured and reliable source of transaction as we all know that how much web 3.0 will be relied on the Blockchain network and as it is our future we also need to be updated with it.
