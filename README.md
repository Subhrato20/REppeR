# Real Estate Management System using Blockchain

## Abstract
Blockchain technology has found applications in various fields, including real estate. This project explores the integration of blockchain in real estate transactions to enhance security, transparency, and efficiency. The traditional real estate process involves complexities, intermediaries, and lack of accessibility, which can be addressed by leveraging blockchain technology. The proposed system aims to streamline property transactions, eliminate middlemen, and provide a secure and transparent platform for buyers and sellers.

## 1. Introduction
Real estate investments are considered safe and secure, but the processes involved are often complicated, costly, and non-transparent. This project aims to revolutionize real estate transactions by implementing a blockchain-based system. The use of blockchain in real estate can eliminate intermediaries, reduce costs, and make the process more accessible to ordinary individuals.

### 1.1 Objective and Goal
The objective is to implement a real estate management system using blockchain technology. The goals include managing property transactions between buyers and sellers without intermediaries, providing a government authenticator for online validation, and ensuring an updated database reflecting property status.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
The existing real estate system faces issues such as paper-related work, centralized processes, and data security concerns. Blockchain is proposed as a solution to eliminate these problems by providing a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform for real estate transactions.

### 1.3 Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to contribute to the government's initiative to go paper-free and streamline land registry processes. Blockchain, known for its success in bitcoin technology, is considered to provide a secure and transparent solution for managing real estate transactions.

### 1.4 Challenges
Challenges include high energy consumption, scalability issues, and the complexity of blockchain networks. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the successful implementation of blockchain in the real estate domain.

## 2. System Design and Implementation
The system will be designed using JavaScript frameworks, with Node.js as the backbone and MongoDB as the database. A custom blockchain will be created to track all transactions securely. The project will also incorporate the zero-knowledge proof algorithm for enhanced security.

## 3. Project Functionalities
- Buying and selling of properties without intermediaries
- Displaying detailed information about bought and sold properties
- File upload functionality
- Checking account balance after buying and selling operations
- Chaining all transactions in the blockchain

## 4. Conclusion
The implementation of a real estate management system using blockchain technology addresses the complexities and inefficiencies of traditional real estate processes. This solution aims to provide a secure, transparent, and accessible platform for real estate transactions.
